<p>Thank you, FLY family!</p>
<p>
Last year marked a significant milestone at FLY. Thanks to your continued support, we celebrated our fifteenth anniversary. Together, we have come a long way from one staff member and a handful of volunteers serving kids in a few neighborhoods in San Jose on a budget of just $32,000. Today, with a budget of $5.6 million, more than 50 FLY employees and 150 volunteers serve more than a thousand youth in 23 Bay Area cities.</p>
<p>
Over the years, you’ve sparked change for thousands of individual youth and their families, and you’ve had a big impact on our wider communities. For example, collaborative efforts with our system and nonprofit partners have resulted in a 77% reduction in juvenile incarceration in Santa Clara County and a 65% reduction in San Mateo County since 2000.</p>
<p>
You made it possible for FLY to sit at the tables where key collaborations were formed that enabled us to support system reforms and suggest strategies to reduce juvenile violence, crime, and incarceration. We were then able to play an important role in putting these ideas into action.  </p>
<P>
This is the power we have in working together. I’m profoundly grateful to all of you — our donors, funders, government and community partners, Board members, staff, and volunteers — for making this amazing journey possible. We look forward to the continued work ahead with gratitude and excitement!

These ground breaking new standards leverage the unique opportunities providers have to build greater equity in educational (and broader life) outcomes for youth in housing. This was a group undertaking involving more than 50 educators, housing representatives, and stakeholders from across the country. Participants included every level of youth work, from direct service providers to senior executives to academic researchers and policy leaders. This diverse group added a unique housing-focused lens to the work of the nearly 500 people who reviewed the initial standards produced by the California Department of Education.
</p>
<p>
Workgroup members were invited to offer input at one of three levels:
</p>
<p>
<span class='bigblues'>Developers</span>—responsible for the initial adaptation
</p>
<p>
<span class='bigblues'>Reviewers</span>—responsible for vetting and supplementing the adapted standards
</p>
<p>
<span class='bigblues'>Endorsers</span>—responsible for signing off on the standards, and ensuring they support high quality youth services
</p>

<p>
The Developers first met in November 2015 for a two-day retreat focused entirely on adapting the original standards. A first draft of the revised standards emerged from that retreat, beginning to address the unique nature of expanded learning programs in public and affordable housing communities. Most notably, a focus on family engagement and program management emerged as critical points which had to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
For the next several months, the Developers worked to align the standards with the realities they faced each day in their programs. The importance of family engagement in housing communities made it clear that it should be a completely new standard, created specifically for housing providers.
</p>
<p>
In February 2016, the draft standards were unveiled at the HousED Summit, with workshops aligned to the standards. This also marked the beginning of several rounds of revisions, as the Reviewers gave feedback and suggestions. Based on their comments and revisions, the standards were sent to several agencies for endorsement. We are thrilled to partner with our Endorsers to share these standards on a national level.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the hard work of everyone involved, the Quality Standards for Expanded Learning in Public and Affordable Housing reflect the views of 13 different housing providers, educational organizations, and housing authorities.

The program has clearly defined their vision, mission, goals, and measurable outcomes that respond to the needs of the community, reflect broad stakeholder input, and drive program design, implementation, and improvement. It demonstrates sound fiscal and administrative practices that are supported by, and communicated to, staff and stakeholders.
