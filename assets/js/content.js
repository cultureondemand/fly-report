 <p>Thank you, FLY family!</p>
<p>
Last year marked a significant milestone at FLY. Thanks to your continued support, we celebrated our fifteenth anniversary. Together, we have come a long way from one staff member and a handful of volunteers serving kids in a few neighborhoods in San Jose on a budget of just $32,000. Today, with a budget of $5.6 million, more than 50 FLY employees and 150 volunteers serve more than a thousand youth in 23 Bay Area cities.</p>
<p>
Over the years, you’ve sparked change for thousands of individual youth and their families, and you’ve had a big impact on our wider communities. For example, collaborative efforts with our system and nonprofit partners have resulted in a 77% reduction in juvenile incarceration in Santa Clara County and a 65% reduction in San Mateo County since 2000.</p>
<p>
You made it possible for FLY to sit at the tables where key collaborations were formed that enabled us to support system reforms and suggest strategies to reduce juvenile violence, crime, and incarceration. We were then able to play an important role in putting these ideas into action.  </p>
<P>
This is the power we have in working together. I’m profoundly grateful to all of you — our donors, funders, government and community partners, Board members, staff, and volunteers — for making this amazing journey possible. We look forward to the continued work ahead with gratitude and excitement!

After 15 years, what continues to move me is how FLY can take young people from wondering if they will even make it past their 18th birthday to a life in which they can really thrive. And once their lives are on track, it’s inspiring to see how much they want to give back other youth and to their communities.
